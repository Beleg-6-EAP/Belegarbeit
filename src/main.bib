abstract = {In resent years monolith architecture gains once again a lot of popularity, in order to reduce costs and time compared to more complicated architectures. Taking into account the advantages of micro-service, and trying to embed some of them to monolith architectures, we come to the creation of modular monoliths. This type of design can be consider quite new, and so there isn’t yet a specific architecture design that someone could follow if they wish to use it. In this paper we present an architectural design and an implementation strategy for modular monoliths. To evaluate the usefulness of this architecture, we have conducted a study, validating the design and its implementation. In this study 12 architects from different companies took part, expressing some concerns regarding the feasibility in bigger project but also giving an overall positive feedback for the design.},

abstract = {Recently, modular monolith architecture has attracted the attention of practitioners, as Google proposed a "Service Weaver" framework to enable developers to write applications as modular monolithic and deploy them as a set of microservices. Google considered it a framework with the best of both worlds, and it seems to be a trend in software architecture. This paper aims to understand the definition of the modular monolith in industry and investigate frameworks and cases building modular monolith architecture. We conducted a systematic grey literature review, and the results show that modular monolith combines the advantages of monoliths with microservices. We found three frameworks and four cases of building modular monolith architecture. In general, the modular monolith is an alternative way to microservices, and it also could be a previous step before systems migrate to microservices.},
